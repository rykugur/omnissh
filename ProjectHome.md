OmniSSH allows you to run commands (or upload files) via SSH (SFTP) concurrently on any number of servers.

In the age of virtualisation, OmniSSH allows you to effectively manage a large number of mostly heterogeneous servers.  It has been described as "a legitimate bot-net". :-)

OmniSSH is written in pure Perl.

OmniSSH was developed by Matt Busigin whilst under the employ of COMAND Solutions, which has graciously permitted the open-source release.
